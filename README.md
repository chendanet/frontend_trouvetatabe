### User journey

When a user visits the site, the home page will consist of a list of establishments with the possibility of filtering by type or by location as well as a map for the location of these establishments.

The user can also create an account and log in as a customer or merchant. Once the user profile has been created, he will receive an email confirming the creation of his account.

As an authenticated user, he will be able to make reservations, write reviews and add favorite establishments. He will have access to his profile with his information such as past reservations, favorite restaurants, etc.

As a merchant, establishments can change the opening hours as well as the quantity of places available. They can also pay for the subscription to the publication of their restaurant on the platform in their space.

The Navbar will permanently have a search bar to filter establishments, it will allow you to disconnect and indicate a link to the blog.
